•	Committee members are not eligible to participate in the hackathon. They may, however, assist teams and mentors during the coding/development phase.

•	There is no country restriction but you must be eligible to receive prizes (in case you win) and you are responsible for paying any taxes on the prize winnings if any.

## Team Formation

•	Team formation will be done during the event

•	Teams can consist of at least two team members to a maximum of five members. Exceptions can be made for teams to have more than five members on a case by case basis. Contact the hackathon committee in case you need to have a team of more than five members.

•	Changes to team members are not permitted after Thursday, October 13, at 12 Noon. Exceptions can be made on a case by case basis as decided by the rules committee.

## Project Development

•	No work may start before the actual date and time of the event. Any teams that violate this rule will be automatically disqualified. The first line of code should be written on or after Thursday, October 13, 2022 (event start time) after the team has registered. However, we encourage you to brainstorm ideas and create wireframes/mock-ups (via our discord server) 

•	Any data science tools, software, game engine, IDE, and/or programming language can be used for the event. If a team member uses a purchased tool licensed to him or her and the license is not transferable to other members the member’s team must choose one available to all participating teams.

•	To ensure a level field for all contestants, all code must be created only at the hackathon. You are permitted to use publicly developed and openly licensed API’s and SDKs for your project.

•	You will only be able to use a pre-public release of a product in developing your project if you bring at least one extra version that can be used by other teams in the Hackathon, and provide any user support needed to teams using the device.

•	Project design/assets can be created prior to the start date of the hackathon. All assets should conform to the Creative Commons License agreement standard or are freely available and you have permission or license to use them. Proof of permission must be given upon request.

•	Assets, SDKs, APIs or other tools or components available under a trial license may be used.

•	A team can submit only one entry for the hackathon. Participation at the hackathon is subjected on a “per-team” basis meaning you are not allowed to be on more than one team at the event.

•	Any intellectual property developed during and within the scope of the hackathon must be open source and licensed under one of the licenses referenced in https://opensource.org/licenses.

•	The license selected by the team must be clearly listed in code (page per page) or a generic page announcing the license the application adheres to. The public code used inside your application should also list the licenses the code is subjected to.

•	A team can use multiple licenses in the application. For example, the public code used could be licensed under the Apache license agreement whereas the code written by the team for the application licensed under the MIT license agreement.

•	A team may not code applications that violate the code of conduct. For example, racially insensitive ideas for an application will automatically be disqualified.

## Project Submission

•	All teams should have a team name, and hold a GitHub account.

•	Create a GitHub repository for your project

  - A link to a video of a screen capture of the application on Youtube.

•	All projects should be submitted to the hackathon GitHub account (TBA) before judging begins. Failure to submit will result in disqualification. Should commit regularly throughout the hackathon to the team repository. Team repositories that are committed in the entirety near the close of the hackathon, Saturday, November 5, 2022, will be examined and the team could be disqualified for a rules violation.
